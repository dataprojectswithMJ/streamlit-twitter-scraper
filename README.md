I have been going through some issues with the slider. Whenever a number is chosen, the scraper always goes over the specified amount. This issue is on top of my priorities list.)

The file can be downloaded.However the option to save file as CSV has to be ***YES***.
At the moment only CSV formats can be exported. I am incorporating other output formats such as:

* JSON
* Excel
* SQLite

## Installation

#### When installing Twint. Follow the following steps to get the modified version of Twint. This is because Twint can get the Limit of tweets incorrect and this modification fixes that.
 1. Go to the Twint file
 2. Navigate into the other smaller **twint** file
 3. Run
   > python3 setup.py install #insert sudo if Linux

### Run Streamlit
